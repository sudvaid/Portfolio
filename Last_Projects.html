     <h5> Python project </h5> 
     <h3> Computer Science Principles </h3>
     <h4> March 2020 </h4>
     <p>
     The objective of the project was to manipulate selected images to meet a specific client's demands, develop our Python programming skills, and highlight our abilities to work with a partner. My role in the game development was both designer and programmer. A personal skill I developed through this process was improving my communication skills and professional language, since we were required to make a slideshow as a report to present to our client. Another skill I learnt was using images that hold value, since we were assigned to choose specific images to demonstrate our filter on. We used images that were clear and very easy to demonstrate on.  My partner and I would collaborate to come up with a plan for execution and would work together to program the code for that. I learned that instead of giving up when acing a problem, one should persist untli they arrive at a solution. Challenges we overcame were understanding the criteria and instruction, coming up with an idea for our filter, and of course, communicating online without in-person coding sessions. My partner and I worked well together becuase we were able to cooperate with each other's schedules, even with quarantine. Find our

     <h5> MIT Project </h5> 
     <h3> Computer Science Principles </h3>
     <h4> October 2019 </h4>
     <p>The objective of our MIT project was to build an MIT app based on what we had learned. This was another project where teamwork was necessary, as we were tasked with working with a partner. My partner and I created a fun Mini Golf Game.  What I learned from this project is that by setting my mind to doing something, there is a lot I can do. As an example, we had initially wanted to put a lake obstacle in our game, but we had agreed that we would probably have no time for that. To our surprise, we were able to add the lake, along with other features. We overcame the challenge of our close-mindedness, and were able to improve our game. Again, my partner and I worked well together, becuase we were able to communicate and coordinate the order of events very well. In this project, I was struggling less for time, and instead was working more towards using extra time to improve our game.   </p>

     <h5> Scratch project </h5> 
     <h3> Computer Science Principles </h3>
     <h4> September 2019 </h4>
     <p>The objective of the project was to build a fully functional, fun game that would demonstrate our knowledge of Scratch programming, and highlight our abilities to work with a partner. My role in the game development rotated between 'navigator' and 'driver'. My partner and I would either be the one leading by giving instructions, while the other one would be the one executing the instructions. I learned that it's better to set a timeline of events to accomplish, rather than working randomly and out of order. This way, we can accomplish our goals by a set date instead of prolonging them until the deadline approaches. Challenges we overcame were slight glitches in the game, including glitches where the dog would not jump. We also learnt to spent less time on the actual appearance of the game, and more on the internal coding. My partner and I worked well together becuase we were able to utilize the strengths of each other to make our project even more fun and interesting to play.  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/327228456/editor">Find our Project!</a> </p>
