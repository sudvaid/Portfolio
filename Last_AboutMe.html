     <p height="450px" class="parabtme col-sm-8">My name is Sudiksha Vaidyanathan. I am an enthusiastic and passionate young coder from the Bay Area. My coding goal is to successfully learn Python as well as other coding languages that are typically regarded as 'difficult.' I want to feel accomplished by learning something that is so easy to give up on. <br><br> Living through the COVID-19 pandemic has changed my mindset about many things; I am more grateful than ever for the time, effort, and dedication that our health profesionals and workers are putting in during these tough times. I have been persuing my longtime dream of sewing clothes for myself, as well as my passion for baking. Academically, I have been furthering my knowledge in precalculus concepts to prepare myself for future math courses. Of course, I have also been savoring my time with my family-especially my brother, who is home from college- indoors. Quarantine has taught me a lesson about how quickly life can change. My self awareness and my knowledge of my personal characteristics have also benefitted.  <br> <br>I am perseverant. Though it can also be a bad thing, I will not stop stop trying until I achieve what I want. This is evident throughout my habits I demonstrate. For example, I hate eating before doing homework, because I want to finish all my work before I do something rewarding. Though I get cranky becuase of my hunger, I will not eat until I finish my task. I also work well in a team. After school I am involved in YSTCA(Youth Service through Cultural Arts), a youth volunteer group, where I am expected to build my team skills, as I am working with a group of four other individuals (plus their parents!) who have very different ideas. I love having other minds to collaborate with. It also builds a sense of solidarity between me and my peers. Academically, I enjoy English- especially the intense Socratic Seminars, in which we argue our point of view on a certain piece of literature. I thoroughly invest myself open mindedly in the ideas that are thrown back and forth in the Seminar, and often facilitate and lead the Seminar by involving the people who have not spoken yet. I am a natural born leader who is able to bring people together in a team. <br><br> In high school, one of my major accomplishments is winning 7th place speaker award at the Stanford Invitation debate tournament, adding to my consistent success in tournaments. Going to tournament rounds means that I must be able to convince the judge of my argument, which helps build my persuasion and argument skills. In addition, I have maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout the progression of my first semester. Being a very creative person, I enjoy putting my ideas on paper to visualize them- flipping through my math notes alone is enough to guarantee a myriad of bright colors and pretty fonts. <br><br> Coding is a fun, though often excruciatingly difficult, activity that is and will change the world forever. And all of us have the potential to create new code. Thank you, and be sure to check out the rest of the site. </p><br><br>
